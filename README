to record from your speaker:

run:
$ pacmd list-sources

find the index, i, of the 'output' source

$ pacmd set-default-source i

Now, open a new terminal and run 
$ aplay -c2 -r44100 -f S16_LE audio/thrift.raw

in the original terminal run

$ ./parec-simple 

When you're done recording, kill parec and run

$ aplay -c2 -r44100 -f S16_LE output.raw

This should play what parec just recorded and wrote out.
